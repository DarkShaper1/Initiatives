shMapper is a plugin, that allows you to create simple crowdsourcing maps based on OpenStreetMap and Yandex.Maps.

== Description ==

The shMapper plugin allows you to create simple crowdsourcing maps on OpenStreetMap with an option of feedback messages form. This plugin gives you an alternative to current online map services such as Yandex.Maps, Google Maps etc which don’t provide the option for users to add new objects.

Most of the code written by Gennadiy Glazunov aka [Genagl](http://genagl.ru)

**Core features**

* Configure and display maps with markers on pages.
* Display maps using shortcodes.
* Receive new map markers via feedback form.
* Pre or post-moderation of new markers.
* reCaptcha form protection.
* Custom markers icons.

PHP at least 5.6 is required for plugin to work correctly.
